# ReviveRide: Modernizing Vintage Autos
### Project Overview
ReviveRide was developed as a capstone project for the Computer Engineering Technology program at Conestoga College. The goal of ReviveRide is to bring features found on modern vehicles to older vehicles. The project provides a dash camera, backup camera, head unit touchscreen with Android Auto, blind spot object detection, and remote start in an all-in-one, easy to install kit.

### Control Module
The control module is responsible for providing power to every component in the system when the car is turned on. It is also responsible for receiving the remote start signal from the key fob and switching voltages to the ignition system to start the car.

This repo contains the schematic and PCB for the control module. The firmware for the control module can be found here: https://github.com/BenMartens15/reviveride-control-module-firmware
